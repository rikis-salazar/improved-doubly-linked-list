### improved-doubly-linked-list
A new and improved __double-linked list__ (a.k.a. _doubly linked list_)

This implementation is considerably more technical than the one
we _home-cooked_. Its limited set of member functions reproduce 
the behavior of the functions in `std::list`. Iterators are also 
defined and can be used like standard iterators 
(e.g. `std::list<int>::iterator it = someList.begin()`).
